# AutoDeduct examples
This repository contains some helper bash scripts and a set of
public examples on which the [AutoDeduct toolchain](https://github.com/rse-verification/auto-deduct-toolchain) has been tested.

Please see the README file in each folder for more information
about that specific example.
